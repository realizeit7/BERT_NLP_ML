## Project Description 
---
### Business Context:
Before replacing a production machine learning model, it's vital to test the new version. This assessment verifies the model's performance against metrics like accuracy, ensuring it neither overfits nor underfits the data. Such testing ensures the model works well across datasets, understands its error types, and guarantees no negative impact on user experience.

### A/B Testing Overview:
A/B testing, in the realm of machine learning, assesses the effectiveness of two models. Users or data are split between a control group (using the existing model) and a treatment group (using the new model). Performance metrics like precision are then compared. For critical applications, like fraud detection, A/B testing confirms not just better performance but also its statistical significance. Conducting such tests requires a vast dataset and defined evaluation metrics, aiming to enhance user experience.

### Project Objective:
In this initiative, we're building a Question and Answer system leveraging BERT and DistilBERT models. Using A/B testing, we'll discern which of the two offers superior performance.

### Technologies:
- **Language**: Python
- **Models**: BERT, DistilBERT
  - **BERT**: Developed by Google, BERT is a pre-trained architecture designed for NLP tasks, utilizing the "Transformer" technique. It's been influential in the industry, with variants like RoBERTa and ALBERT arising subsequently.
  - **DistilBERT**: Introduced by Hugging Face, DistilBERT is a streamlined version of BERT. It maintains significant performance while being faster and consuming less memory, attributed to the "distillation" technique. It's available via Hugging Face's transformers library.
